**Hey** my name is __Lucas Aguiar__

very nice to meet you!

I usually save here some code that I develop in whatever language comes to my mind.

I don't have anything very relevant yet, but I'm developing new stuff daily, but I usually forget to put it here :P

I still don't know how I got that grade but I intend to improve!
