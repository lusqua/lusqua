_I still don't know how I got that grade but I intend to improve!_

```python
def say_Hello():
    return 'Hello World!'

if __name__ == __main__:
    print(say_Hello)

```

`> Hello World!`


**Hey** my name is __Lucas Aguiar__

very nice to meet you!

I usually save here some code that I develop in whatever language comes to my mind.

I don't have anything very relevant yet, but I'm developing new stuff daily, but I usually forget to put it here :P

From time to time I post some things I have learned on my [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNmf0farlHlsuu0xA0DwGeQ) channel.
