# Software Developer | TypeScript, Golang, MongoDB & Kubernetes Enthusiast | Open Source Contributor | Mongodb User Group Leader

Passionate about software development, problem-solving, and building scalable solutions. With experience in TypeScript, Golang, MongoDB, and Kubernetes, I’ve contributed to significant projects and enjoy collaborating on open-source initiatives.

I am actively involved in the MongoDB community in Santa Catarina, where I help organize events and occasionally give talks about MongoDB and software development. Sharing knowledge and connecting with others in the tech community is something I deeply value.

Aspired to expand my skills in DevOps and Infrastructure, I’m fascinated by hardware, servers, and the intricate details of how they work. Holding certifications as a server technician and in electronics, I combine practical knowledge with hands-on experience in managing and optimizing systems. Currently, I’m pursuing a bachelor’s degree in engineering, now halfway through, complementing my technical expertise.

I thrive on challenges and take pride in creating solutions that make a difference. Let’s build something amazing together!
